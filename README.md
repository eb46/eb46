### Hi there, I'm Eric! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and Photographer based in Southern California. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for [JMJ Financial](https://web.jmj.me/), a care management platform helping to build a community of people united to support loved ones in need of critical healthcare necessities.

I'm huge on collaboration and a strong believer in "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." - African Proverb

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling, and playing sports.
